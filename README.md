**Mineral Resource Extraction Detection (MRED) Tool in Digital Earth Pacific (DEP)**

The DEP MRED Toolbox:

1. Options to use existing model datasets trained from ground and labelled data in Fiji or to input your own localised datasets. 
2. Random forest predictions of 8 land cover classes including quarry stockpiles, and bare land and water land cover classes as a proxy for mineral extraction activities.
3. Annual change detection to quantify areas of expansion and regeneration over mining areas.
